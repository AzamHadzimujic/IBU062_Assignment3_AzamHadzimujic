Steps to Setup the DHCP on the Router in the Configuration:

Firstly enter configuration mode with:
enable
configure terminal

Then create the DHCP pools for both of the switches with:
First Switch:
ip dhcp pool FIRST_POOL
network 168.90.0.0 255.255.0.0
default-router 168.90.0.1

Second Switch:
ip dhcp pool SECOND_POOL
network 210.3.14.0 255.255.255.0
default-router 210.3.14.1

Then exclude the IP Addresses that are reserved for the router so they are not handed to the hosts in the network with:
ip dhcp excluded-address 168.90.0.1
ip dhcp excluded-address 210.3.14.1

With these next lines you are ensuring that the router interfaces are configured 
with the correct IP addresses and are active:
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 168.90.0.1 255.255.0.0
no shutdown

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
ip address 210.3.14.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown

At the end just type end to exit the configuration mode and then you can close the window.
